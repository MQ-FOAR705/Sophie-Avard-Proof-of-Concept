A growing body of research acknowledges the subjectivity of the presentation and conceptualization of mental ill-health and calls for emic research that understands non-Western explanatory models and forms screening tools and diagnostic frameworks from local concepts (Summerfield 2008; Kaiser et al. 2014; Weaver 2017). Incorporating local idioms of mental distress into mental healthcare and psychiatric treatment has become an increasingly well-recognized way of prioritizing

Ideally, understanding a particular culture’s articulation of mental distress can inform medical practices built from local ideologies in which patients can see their culture and belief system reflected. Especially in rural areas in sub-Saharan Africa, where somatic symptoms are strongly associated with mental distress (Quarshie 2006), healthcare environments that utilize open communication about symptoms associated with mental distress and their social context can provide a deeper understanding and more holistic view of these conditions. Early ethnographic explorations of idioms of mental distress in non-Western contexts have evolved to a more nuanced discussion of the relationships between expressions of mental suffering and the broader social, cultural, religious, and political context. The term ‘‘idioms of distress’’ refers to culturally specific"

Subsequent studies have used these ethnopsychologies as a basis to create culturally informed screening tools for depression and childhood trauma (Kohrt et al. 2011).

A large portion of the population in this region sought refuge in Côte D’Ivoire during the civil war, which led to the substantial disruption of the healthcare system. Following the civil war, one epidemiological survey found 40% of adults met the criteria for Major Depressive Disorder and 44% met the criteria for PTSD (Johnson et al. 2008). Liberia has one psychiatric hospital and considerable stigma exists surrounding mental healthcare, for both clinicians and patients (Esan et al. 2014; World Health Organizat"
