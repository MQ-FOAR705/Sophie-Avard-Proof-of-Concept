"1","1","idioms of distress","We employed a sequential mixed-methods process of: (1) free-lists and semi-structured interviews (n = 20); patient chart reviews (n = 315); (2) pile-sort exercises, (n = 31); and (3) confirmatory focus group discussions (FGDs); (n = 3) from June to December 2017. Free-lists identified 64 idioms of distress, 36 of which were eliminated because they were poorly understood, stigmatizing, irrelevant, or redundant. The remaining 28 terms were used in pile-sort exercises to visualize the interrelatedness of idioms. Confirmatory FDGs occurred before and after the pile-sort exercise to explain findings. Four categories of idioms resulted, the most substantial of which included terms related to the heart and to the brain/mind."
"2","1","idioms of distress","In Haiti, for instance, locally-developed screening tools that incorporated idioms of distress were associated with better specificity and cultural equivalence than screening tools that were directly translated from English to Haitian Kreyól (Kaiser et al. 2013). The problematic imposition of Western conceptualizations of mental illness on non-Western cultures perpetuates paternalist and neo-colonial practices that exclude local ideologies at the expense of those suffering from mental distress"
"3","1","women","In Guinea Bissau, the phenomenon of kiyang-yang arose among Balanta women as a way of expressing both individual and collective trauma associated with poverty, conflict, and as a way of emphasizing the oppressive aspects of Balanta society that reinforced these stressors (de Jong and Reis 2010). This term’s use as an expression of political dissent as well as individual and collective suffering and mental distress further illustrates the multifaceted and complex utility of idioms of distress in communicating trauma and distress on both an individual and societal level"

"5","1","gender","We reviewed a census of 315 charts and extracted qualitative data from 189 that contained a substantive patient history and/or presenting complaints section. Re-sults were coded for symptomatology and idioms using QSR NVivo 11 software. Step 4: Screening Tool Development The final screening tool contained two domains, one with locally-derived idioms of distress each paired with a function impairment question, and the other with common physical manifestations of mental suffering. We sought confirmation and further explanation of the results of the free-list and pile-sort exercises in two focus groups, one with 9 lay community members (3 women and 6 men) and one with 4 mental health clinicians (2 women and 2 men). For terms represented in the graphic visualization of the cluster analysis (Fig. 2), we engaged in a discussion designed to clarify which terms in each distinct cluster were the most appropriate for a screening tool."
"6","1","emotions","The eigenratio resulting from the consensus analysis was 7.087, indicating agreement among participants. The two most substantial categories include terms related to the heart and terms related to the brain and mind. Out of the 28 terms included in the pile-sort activity, 75% fell into one of these two categories. Heart-related terms, which accounted for 10 of 28, primarily described various emotions or emotional states. Specifically, several terms related to feeling upset, angry, or short tempered (heart not good, heart heavy, heart spoiled)."
"7","1","emotions","One mental health clinician suggested these terms can refer to panic attacks, though differentiating between this and other interpretations including losing consciousness and epileptic episodes remains a challenge. The largest cluster, comprising 11 of the 28 pile-sort terms (39%), included terms related to the mind or brain. Contrasting to the heart-related terms that primarily described emotions and emotional states, this cluster includes terms related to thinking, focus, and attention."
"8","1","women","eart idioms were also referred to as precursors for illness, though these idioms were more commonly associated with physical illness. Respondents linked heart cut and other heart idioms to sickness and pressure, which shares many symptoms with hypertension and can lead to death. Similar connections exist in other settings, including among Punjabis living in Britain, where a sinking heart can lead to heart attacks, and among women in northern India, where tension is associated with high blood pressure and diabetes (Krause 1989; Weaver 2017)."
